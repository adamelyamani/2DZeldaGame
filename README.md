# 3902-Project

**Current Game Summary**
Our game requires Monogame to run. The game is a close spin off of Zelda with different sprites and an increase in the amount of unique items.
The game features more freedom in player movement and attacking, allowing for the player to move and attack in 360 degrees.
To start the game, choose your character from the selection screen. To progress throughout the dungeon, you mus defeat all the enemies in the room, which will reward you with a key. Once you have a key, you can run into a locked door to unlock it to get to the next room.
The goal of the dungeon is to find and defeat the boss. Goodluck!
